# Caltech-256-Activation-Maximization
Optimizing images to maximize activation of output neurons of a classification model trained for the Caltech 256 dataset.
<br>It is mainly lower-level features but still interesting.

In order to try it out download the latest release and make sure to set up the proper file paths.
<br> If you just want to view some of the results check out the [Image Results](Image-Results) folder (I know the images are out of order).
<br> My favorite images are #18 which is the bowling pins where you can clearly discern the red horizontal stripes.
<br> I also really like # 78 which are fried eggs as you can clearly see the yolk and whites.
