# Caltech-256-Activation-Maximization
Optimizing images to maximize activation of output neurons of a classification model trained for the Caltech 256 dataset.
It is mainly lower-level features but still interesting.

In order to try it out download the latest release and make sure to set up the proper file paths.
If you just want to view some of the results check out the [Image Results](Caltech-256-Activation-Maximization/Image Results/) folder
My favorite image is #18 which is the bowling pins. You can clearly discern the red horizontal stripes.
